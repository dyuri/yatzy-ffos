Yatzy can be played solitaire or by any number players. Players take turns rolling five dice. After each roll, the player chooses which dice to keep, and which to reroll. A player may reroll some or all of the dice up to two times on a turn. The player with the highest total score wins the game. After each round (3 rolls / round) points must be entered into a table.
